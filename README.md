COPY MOCE FORGERY DETECTION 

My teamates and I developed a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CASIA 2.0 dataset, employing various weight initialization techniques to achieve a testing accuracy of 96.90% in detecting picture modifications. The model was deployed to the cloud using Amazon EC2, ensuring accessibility for users. Additionally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized for picture categorization. To make the model more user-friendly, we created an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) website that allows individuals to easily test and interact with the system.
